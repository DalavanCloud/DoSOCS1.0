<h5>System Overview</h5>

<div>
<p>
The Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) specification is a formatting standard for communicating the licenses and copyrights associated with a software package. Being able to explicate this information is a required function for operations support system management within an organization.
</p>

<p>
DoSPDX is aimed at processing software packages into SPDX documents. This utility will scan, store, and print spdx documents. In the future DoSPDX will also parse SPDX documents. DoSPDX Stores SPDX docs in a MySQL database, the same that is documented <a href="https://github.com/spdx-tools/Database">here</a>.
